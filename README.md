<h2 align="center">About me</h2>

<p>As a software engineer with a background in telecommunications, I bring a unique perspective and a set of skills to the field of bioinformatics. My proficiency in programming and machine learning along with my experience in building robust and scalable systems, allows me to approach problem-solving in bioinformatics from a different angle. I am currently furthering my education by studying for a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Potsdam. My goal is to use my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and make a positive impact in healthcare and biotechnology.</p>
